# Project Description
* Modeled emergency service routing and capacity allocation with limited vehicle, hard time windows and multiple round trips, in order to minimize the total waiting time costs and unsaved demands;
* Compared the separated routing schemes and the integrated routing schemes, to find out the influence of the combination of vehicles on the delivery efficiency;
* Designed Genetic Algorithm with cross-over and mutation strategies after splitting the demands and encoding the vehicleâ€™s trajectory.
